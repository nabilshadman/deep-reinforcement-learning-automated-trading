# Experiments

This folder contains the results, data, and visualisations from the various experiments conducted for the MSc dissertation project on **"Comparison of Deep Reinforcement Learning Models for Automated Trading on Heterogeneous HPC System."**

## Contents

- `experiment1_baseline_comparison.xlsx` – Results from the baseline performance comparison between DQN and PPO models, including charts visualising portfolio performance and execution times.
- `experiment2_hyperparameter_tuning.xlsx` – Data and charts from hyperparameter tuning experiments to optimise model performance.
- `experiment3_scaling_stocks.xlsx` – Results and visualisations from experiments on scaling the number of stocks in the portfolio.
- `experiment4_transferability.xlsx` – Data and charts from the transfer learning experiments, testing model performance on unseen datasets.


## Description

Each Excel file contains detailed results and charts from specific sets of experiments conducted during the project. These files include data such as portfolio values, execution times, resource utilisation, and other performance metrics. The visualisations help in analysing and comparing the effectiveness of the DQN and PPO algorithms under various experimental conditions.
