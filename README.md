Both of the repository and its wiki (where applicable) should be clear and easy to navigate,  
and show a good level of organisation. There should be READMEs throughout the repository,  
signposting content to the visitor. A top-level README should include the main project information,  
such as (1) project title, (2) your name and (3) the name(s) of your supervisor(s). There  
should also be a brief description of the proposed project and its background.
